#Welcome to Maxym's Project section

This project was originally created for a class from my university. We were trying to created a Machine learning algorithm that gives an output to user on their susceptibility to contract COVID-19 based on their personal information as well as their possible symptoms and the likelihood of turning into serious illness.

This project was originally co-created by me and my teammates from that class. However we weren't able to complete this project. Now, with me having all these free time I might as well finish what we've started.
